    1. Pitcher Name<br>
    2. Batter Name<br>
    3. Pitch Type<br>
    4. Pitch Speed<br>
    5. Result (Hit, Strikeout, etc.)<br>

    Then, it will analyze the scraped data of each YS batter or YS pitcher performance.<br>

    For a batter, it will calculate their wOBA against specific pitchers of opposing team using the standard formula with NPB weights (weights from 1point02.com) i.e. Namiki's wOBA against Carp's Mori.<br>
